# AUSWeather
Predicting next-day rainfall across Australia using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. Includes data cleaning, EDA, model training, and evaluation using the AUS weather dataset.

# 🌦️ Australian Weather Prediction – ML Project

This project was developed as part of the IBM "Machine Learning with Python" course on Coursera. It focuses on predicting whether it will rain the next day using historical weather data from Australia.

## 📊 Overview
- **Goal**: Predict `RainTomorrow` (Yes/No) using various weather features.
- **Dataset**: Australian historical weather data (~145k rows across multiple cities).
- **Approach**:
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training & evaluation

## 🧠 ML Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
